# Documentation

In this folder you'll find documentation about how to configure Kowl and Kowl Business. Kowl Business is a wrapper around Kowl and provides additional functionality (see [Features](https://github.com/cloudhut/kowl#features)). This means that all config options of Kowl also apply to Kowl Business but not vice versa. Documentation pages which only apply to Kowl Business are clearly marked at the top of the page.

If there are still open questions after reading this documentation please don't hesitate to submit an issue.
